        <h3>World</h3>
        <p>Karlovy Vary in the early 17th century form your hub and your pressure cooker. Bathhouses, workshops, guild houses, backrooms, and cellars connect into a dense, walkable city. You move between laboratories, furnaces, and patrons - balancing reputation, access, and scarce materials. There are no weapons and no combat; the conflict lives in ambitions, scarcity, and risk.</p>

        <h3>Systems</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Playable alchemy built on real procedures - distillation, calcination, dissolution, precipitation, crystallisation, and thermal control with systemic outcomes.</li>
          <li>No combat loop - progression comes from knowledge, experimentation, negotiation, and managing failures like cracked glassware, bad reagents, or unstable furnaces.</li>
          <li>City-scale strategy - patrons, rival alchemists, guilds, and suppliers shape what you can attempt, buy, or access at any given time.</li>
          <li>Persistent consequences - your choices in the lab and in the city echo across future opportunities, prices, and trust.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tech</h3>
        <p>Submontium is built with Unreal Engine, Blender, Marmoset, and Mari. The focus is on realistic stylisation: physically grounded materials, consistent texel density for hero assets, and first-person interiors lit by fire, glass, and stone. Systems are designed to be reproducible and transparent - if a reaction fails, it fails for understandable reasons.</p>
